Employment as a Certified Nurse Assistant typically requires the person to meet general health standards, and requires heavy physical tasks such as lifting, pushing, or pulling required objects up to 50 lbs. It also requires lifting clients who might weigh up to 200 pounds. For employment, aides must be in good health; a physical exam might be required; and a criminal background check is generally a prerequisite. Aides should be tactful, patient, understanding, emotionally stable, and dependable. They should desire to help people. Upon successful completion of the course materials and 120 required hours of training (one period per day in a semester-long class plus 25 evenings of clinical experience hours), students will be awarded a certificate and a grade report that serve as documentation of the successful completion and the training hours attended.

The dual enrollment courses with Roane State Community College offered through i-School include concepts of STEM in Context with a STEM Practicum. These are applied courses in the STEM career cluster which allow students to work in groups to solve a problem or answer a scientific question drawn from real-world scenarios within their schools or communities. This course builds on i-School STEM I: Digital Design & Manufacturing 1 and i-School STEM IIA, B, or C: Applications by applying scientific and engineering knowledge and skills to team projects. These DE courses with RSCC are capstone courses intended to provide students with the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge learned in previous STEM Education courses within a professional, working environment. In addition to developing an understanding of the professional and ethical issues encountered by STEM professionals in the workplace, students learn to refine their skills in problem solving, research, communication, data analysis, teamwork, and project management. The course is highly customizable to meet local system needs: instruction may be delivered through school laboratory training or through work-based learning arrangements such as internships, cooperative education, service learning, mentoring, and job shadowing. Upon completion of this course, proficient students will be able to effectively use skills such as project management, team communication, leadership, and decision making.

The best place to begin is with a refresher on Greek myth and its Roman counterparts.

As time allows, study will shift to Central/South American and Asian mythologies. Students will also be expected to complete an independent research project on a Native American myth. Goals of the course will be for students to learn the major figures and stories of each older culture’s myths, to understand how environment and culture influence a society’s view of the world, and to look past superficial differences in order to realize the common origins and elements that connect all humans.",

Students complete an extensive literary research project and are expected to complete most reading and writing assignments out of class. \n AP United States History: The AP U.S. History course develops students’ understanding of American history from approximately 1491 to the present. Students will investigate U.S. history for significant events, individuals, developments, and processes across historical periods. Students will develop the same thinking skills and methods used by historians:  analysis of primary and secondary sources, contextualization, comparison, causation, continuity and change over time, and argumentation. The course also looks at seven themes:  American and national identity; politics and power; work, exchange, and technology; culture and society; migration and settlement; geography and the environment; and America in the world. Students will explore these themes in order to make connections among historical developments in different times and places in preparation for the AP U. S.

Students work to develop a mastery of concept, composition, and execution of their personal ideas and themes in one of the chosen portfolio areas. The course emphasizes art making as an ongoing process involving critical thinking, personal expression, and material exploration, as well as a variety of concepts and approaches in design problem solving.  The course examines two aspects of portfolio development—Sustained Investigation and Selected Works. Throughout the year, the students complete work towards these two sections. Selected Works will be teacher driven, although previous quality work may be considered for this section. The theme for the development of a personal concentrated body of work will be identified through discussion and critique between the student and teacher. The Sustained Investigation will focus on a group of related works. These works must demonstrate a serious purpose and show growth over time. Group critiques are necessary for assessment throughout the art production. An ongoing dialog with the teacher and documentation of artwork will be mandatory.
