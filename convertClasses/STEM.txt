STEM II: Applications is a project-based learning experience for students who wish to further explore the dynamic range of STEM fields introduced in STEM I: Foundations. Building on the content and critical thinking frameworks of STEM I, this course asks students to apply the scientific inquiry and engineering design processes to a course-long project selected by the instructor with the help of student input. Instructors design a project in one of two broad pathways (traditional sciences or engineering) that reflects the interest of the class as a whole; the students then apply the steps of the scientific inquiry or the engineering design process throughout the course to ask questions, test hypotheses, model solutions, and communicate results. In some cases, instructors may be able to design hybrid projects that employ elements of both the scientific inquiry and the engineering design process. Upon completion of this course, proficient students will have a thorough understanding of how scientists and engineers research problems and methodically apply STEM knowledge and skills; and they will be able to present and defend a scientific explanation and/or an engineering design solution to comprehensive STEM-related scenarios. This course aligns with the programs of study that have been taught in Oak Ridge Schools with Project Lead the Way and Engineering by Design curricula.
