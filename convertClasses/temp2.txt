Students must have a strong interest in working with clay materials. Students will learn basic hand-building, wheel throwing, firing, and alternative clay techniques. Students will create and design sculptural, functional, and well-crafted works of art as they relate to ceramics. There is a significant amount of studio maintenance required in this class, and a grade is calculated for this activity. Attendance is an important factor in this class and will be considered when students apply for the course. Tools and materials are not available for home use. Upon completion of the college semester, students are required to submit a portfolio of their work for the college credit.",

The course prepares students for three different AP Exams. Students choose from a 2-D design portfolio, drawing portfolio, or 3-D Design portfolio. Students work to develop a mastery of concept, composition, and execution of their personal ideas and themes in one of the chosen portfolio areas. The course emphasizes art making as an ongoing process involving critical thinking and personal expression, as well as a variety of concepts and approaches in design problem solving.  The course examines two aspects of portfolio development—Sustained Investigation and Selected Works. Throughout the year, the students complete work towards these two sections. Selected Works will be teacher driven, although previous quality work may be considered for this section. The theme for the development of a personal concentrated body of work will be identified through discussion and critique between the student and teacher. The Sustained Investigation will focus on a group of related works. These works must demonstrate a serious purpose and show growth over time. Group critiques are necessary for assessment throughout the art production. An ongoing dialog with the teacher and documentation of artwork will be mandatory.",
