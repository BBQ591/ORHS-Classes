AP Computer Science Principles	S,T,E,M	323635
GPA Weight: 1.0	Grading Scale: Honors; Advanced Placement if exam taken	NCAA Approved? No
Length: Semester	Number of Credits: 1.0	Grade Level: 9,10,11,12
AP Computer Science Principles focuses on foundational computing skills to help students understand the relevance of those computing skills to their college and career plans. Multidisciplinary in nature, this course teaches students how to analyze problems, use creative thinking, and create computational artifacts including programs. Throughout the course, students will collaborate to investigate real-world issues using computing. The course focuses on seven major ideas in computing: Creativity, Abstraction, Data and Information, Algorithms, Programming, Internet, and Global Impact. AP computer science options include both AP Computer Science A (G02H45) and AP Computer Science Principles (G02H44). Both courses can substitute for 4th year math if the student has reached the mathematics college readiness benchmark of 22 on the ACT. https://www.tn.gov/education/instruction/academic-standards/computer-science.html

Students will follow the Advanced Placement Computer Science curriculum outline. AP booklets with a detailed course description are available through the AP Computer Science teacher or the Guidance Office. The major emphasis of this course is on programming methodology, algorithms, and data structures using JAVA. Applications are used to develop student awareness of the need for particular algorithms and data structures, as well as to provide topics for programming assignments to which the students can apply their knowledge. Treatments of computer systems and social implications of computing are integrated into the course work and not isolated as separate units. AP computer science options include both AP Computer Science A (G02H45) and AP Computer Science Principles (G02H44). Both courses can substitute for 4th year math if the student has reached the mathematics college readiness benchmark of 22 on the ACT. https://www.tn.gov/education/instruction/academic-standards/computer-science.html
